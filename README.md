# ðŸŒ¿ AI-Based Plant Disease Detection Using Leaf Images

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect plant diseases from leaf images. Built using Python, TensorFlow, and Flask, this model helps farmers and agriculturists to identify diseases early and take corrective actions.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Detects multiple plant diseases using deep learning
- Simple web interface to upload leaf images
- Built using TensorFlow and Flask
- Trained on the PlantVillage dataset

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

We used the [PlantVillage dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease) available on Kaggle.  
After downloading, extract the contents and rename the folder to `dataset/`.
